<h2>I) Usage</h2>
<p>You can download the quangKy2k7-main.zip file to see the source code of my apps. If you want to run the app on my source code, please spend time reading the README.md file in the zip file because it contains guidance about setup, libraries, and required devices to run the app</p>
<p>You can also download the apk file to run on your android device or android simulator like BlueStacks App Player. The apk file : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1502P9g87BxBo6lq2ZWPVup8ySswlMuH_/view?usp=sharing</p>
<h2>II) Demo video</h2>
